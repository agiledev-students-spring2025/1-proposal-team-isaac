# BookBroker - Project Proposal

## What and why?
Books are an expensive thing to only use once. BookBroker is a system for circulating books that facilitates direct trades without payment, making literature more accessible to readers and preventing old books from gathering dust on shelves.

## For whom?
Readers, students. Anyone with books that wants books

## How?
Users can create a list of the books they're willing to part with alongside a wishlist of books they'd like. From there, each user can make a direct match with another user if wishlist items line up on both sides, or simply browse books that are available and offer exchanges. The goal is a completely trade-based ecosystem of literature.

## Scope
This project has lots of room for features including direct messaging, authenticated logins, social media-like browsing feeds, and content personalization without being suffocatingly complex on a surface level.
